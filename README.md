# Data Visualisation - NYPD Dataset: Problem Statements

This case study aims to address the following queries:
1. What was the total number of incidents reported in 2020, organized by month and type?
2. Create a chart that displays the contribution of each borough to total incidents.
3. Identify the hour with the highest number of incidents on a particular weekday.
4. Create a line chart illustrating the fluctuation in total incidents over the years.
5. Determine which type of incident was the most reported in June.

# DataSets used:

A combination of 4 dataset files is used, given as follows:
1. INCIDENTS
2. INCIDENT TYPES
3. LOCATIONS
4. REPORT DETAILS

These datasets are combined to form a single DATA MODULE.

# Software used: IBM Cognos

# Introduction

# NYPD Incident Dataset

The NYPD Incident Dataset is a fictional dataset commonly used as an example in data analytics and business intelligence courses, including IBM Cognos. The dataset contains information about reported incidents over some time, including details about the type of incidents, the locations where they occurred, and the dates and times of the incidents.

The dataset typically includes variables such as:
1. Date: the date of the incident,
2. Incident ID: the ID of the reported incident,
3. Incident Type: the type of the incident that was reported,
4. Borough: the borough where the incident occurred,
5. Incident Time: the time the incident was reported,
6. Quantity: the number of incidents reported in the transaction, etc.

Using this dataset, analysts can gain insights into various aspects of public safety, such as which types of incidents are most common, which boroughs have the highest number of incidents, and which times of day have the most reported incidents. These insights can then be used to make data-driven decisions that help improve public safety and resource allocation.
